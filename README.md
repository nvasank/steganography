🔹 Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

📌 Project Description
This project provides a secure and user-friendly method for hiding secret messages inside images using steganography and password-protected encryption. It ensures that confidential information can be safely embedded within an image and retrieved only by authorized users with the correct password.

Using AES encryption, the message is first encrypted with a user-provided password, making it unreadable without decryption. The encrypted message is then embedded into an image using steganography, ensuring that the presence of hidden data remains undetectable.

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter makes the tool accessible to users without requiring technical expertise. The project is useful for secure communication, data protection, and cybersecurity applications.

💡 Key Features:

✅ Password-Protected Encryption – Ensures only authorized users can decrypt the message

✅ Steganography – Hides the message inside an image without altering its appearance

✅ User-Friendly GUI – No need for command-line operations, just select an image, enter text & password

✅ Offline & Secure – Works locally on your computer, no internet connection required

✅ Cross-Platform – Compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux

This project is perfect for cybersecurity professionals, journalists, developers, and privacy-conscious users who need a safe and efficient method for secure communication. 🚀🔐
